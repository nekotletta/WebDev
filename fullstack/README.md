## How to run the app: 

1. Open two terminals, navigate to ./backend/src, and ./frontend/src

### For the React (frontend)

2. Run npm install 
3. Run npm run dev
4. Run o + enter, so that the app is displayed on the browser, or, click on the link provided by the previous command.

### For the Node (backend)

5. Run node server.js on the terminal.

With both terminals up and running, you can access the link provided by React and use the app.

## API Endpoints

To read about the API endpoints and their required fields, you should read the README located in the backend directory.

## Bonuses

I had already done password encryption for the last assignment; I would like to receive credit for the contact module. 

I would've done the forgotten password bonus too if I had time. That'll be left for after I graduate :)
